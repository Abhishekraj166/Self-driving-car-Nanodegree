# Self-driving-car-Nanodegree
Learning to build the future, today!  Self-driving cars represent one of the most significant advances in modern history. Their impact will go beyond technology, beyond transportation, beyond urban planning to change our daily lives in ways we have yet to imagine. 
 
 Here are some considerations:  
* self-driving vehicles will save a lot of lives 
* they will make our lives also more comfortable (e.g. mobility for seniors) 
* transport will be delivered as a service from companies who own fleets of self-driving vehicles 
* transportation will become more tightly integrated and packaged into many services 
* premium vehicle services will be available 
* being able to avoid crashes will change the vehicle body construction radically 
* interior equipment will focus even more on comfort
* emotion (max. speed, acceleration, handling, exterior design ..) might almost entirely leave transportation 
* are parking lots or parking spaces in town centers necessary anymore? 
* traffic flow will be better regulated 
* infrastructure utilization will be optimized 
* a hugh amount of data will be collected and used 
* hacking of vehicles will be a serious issue ... 

In this program you could learn the skills and techniques used by self-driving car teams at the most innovative companies in the world like NVIDIA, Mercedes-Benz, Uber ATG, Elektrobit. This amazing technology is practiced through interactive projects in computer vision, robotic controls, localization, path planning, machine learning and more.
